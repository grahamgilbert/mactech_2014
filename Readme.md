Code from "Twisting Munki"
=====================

This is (most) of the code used in my talk at MacTech 2014. Here are some of the other things I talk about:

* [How Munki decides what needs to be installed](https://github.com/munki/munki/wiki/How-Munki-Decides-What-Needs-To-Be-Installed)
* [mcxToProfile](https://github.com/timsutton/mcxToProfile)
* [make-profile-pkg](https://github.com/timsutton/make-profile-pkg)
* [Sal](https://github.com/salsoftware/sal)
* [Sal+](http://salsoftware.com)
